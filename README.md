Below are the two ideas that I am currently thinking about for this project

1.
The first idea I have is not really a game but more of a temperature and light sensor, which has high numbers and many lights on when it
is warm and/or a lot of light, but less lights and smaller numbers when it is cold and/ or there is very little light. The inputs for 
doing this idea would be have a light and temperature sensor as input hardware, as well as the microchip which will be receiving data 
from  . Output hardware’s would consist of the 8 LED pole thing and the LED that is used to create numbers from 0-8.  What I would use is 
if there is a lot of light in a room and it is warm, then the numbers will be low as well as the LED pole thing will have change lights 
very slowly. I am also thinking about the possibility of having the light sensor and the temperature output be separated from each other,
and have two different devices showing their values individually.
Inputs:
•	Temperature sensor
•	Light sensor
•	The microchip
Outputs:
•	Light pole (light that has 8 LED ladder on it. We used it in one of our labs
•	LED that is used to show the numbers

2.
The second idea I have and the one that I am leaning more towards is 
have a mini game on the OLED where a player throws a ball into a net area and a goalie 
(which is going to be another person) has to stop the shot. The goalie at the ball will be two circles on the OLED,
\where if the ball hits the goalie then there is no goal. If the ball passes the goalie and hits the end of the screen, it is a goal.
My input hardware pieces would be the OLED, which will take an input as well as two turn able switches (dial switch) which will 
be used to control the movement of where the ball is shot from and where the goalie moves, and a button which controls when the ball 
gets shot. My output would be all on the OLED.

Inputs:
•	Button
•	Two dial switches
•	Microchip
•	OLED
Output:
•	OLED
•	Microchip
